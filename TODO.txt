    must include simple community constructions (villages) to well-separated structures of a city
    advanced cities:
        city mayor (will control city options for constructors, residents) ->
        city structure (structure and homes, city buildings, city building storage for construction) ->
        economy for the city (taxes, income, automatic item buy for city building storage) ->
        stores (city-shared storage)
    with each updates, more homes allowed with more structure blocks allowed
}

    fixed amount of money
    how to determinate who/how/when gets the amount?
}
